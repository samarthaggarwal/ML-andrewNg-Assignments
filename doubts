week4:
1. displayData code??
2. fmincg code?

week5:
Q1) Why is delta equal to derivative of cost wrt z values? Mathematical proof?
Q2) Where does the term sqrt(6/L_out + L_in) come from and why is it a good start for random initialization? Moreover, how do we judge whether a particular initialization is good or not?
Q3) Can someone please explain me the code of ComputeNumericalGradient() and debugInitialWeights() ?
